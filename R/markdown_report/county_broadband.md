As one would reasonably expect, rural counties, on average, have less broadband access. While the distributions do overlap substantially, it's notable that the rural median is close to the nonrural first quartile. The nonrural median fraction appears to by around 0.7, while the rural median fraction is closer to 0.6. By virtue of the distributional center being closer to the midpoint of the physical bounds, the rural distribution is closer to symmetric, while they both have some skew, with the longer tail extending into the lower values.

### A map of all the counties and their fractional broadband access
The following cell has all the lines commented out, because internet problems were preventing me from repeatedly running the `st_transform()` function. I instead exported the transformed shapefile after getting it to work and simply loaded it locally any time it was subsequently necessary.


```R
# The geometry is already there for us from the geometry = True tag earlier.

# But, we still need to rearrange the noncontiguous parts and specify the projection.
# county <- county %>% shift_geometry()
# county <- st_transform(county, crs=5070)
# st_write(county,'../data/counties-broadband-shape.shp',append=FALSE)
```


```R
# f <- ggplot(data=county)+
ggplot(data=county)+
      geom_sf(data = county, fill = NA, color = "gray80", size = 0.1) +
      geom_sf(
        data = filter(county), #is_rural == "Rural"), #If only plotting rural counties
        aes(fill = broadband_frac),
        color = NA
      ) +
    scale_fill_viridis(name = "fraction with access", na.value = "grey90") +
    labs(title = "Fraction of households with broadband",
        subtitle = "By county",
        caption = "Source: US Census ACS")+
    theme_cori_map()
# save_plot(f,"../export/broadband-2.png",chart_width=9,chart_height=7)
```

This is a rich visualization with more to be learned than I can process in this short time. The pieces that I notice will surely be a reflection of my personal and intellectual interests.

First, the northeast stands out as a region with anomolously extensive broadband access, especially in the band spanning from Massachussetts to DC. There's also a noticeable cluster of low access around Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Predictably, large portions of northern Alaska have virtually nonexistent broadband access. Access is also notably low in Puerto Rico, southern Virginia, the dividing line between Oregon/Idaho and California/Nevada, and on the northern half of the Arizona - New Mexico border. 

It's hard to avoid the overlap between these low-access areas and historical (in some cases, ongoing) oppression. The deep south continued relied on slavery for longer than other parts of the union, and implemented a series of legislation to prevent the distribution of rights and freedoms to Black Americans after emancipation. The eastern border of Arizona is contained by some of the most notoriously dangerous parts of Navajo Nation, where violence against indigenous women goes systemically unaddressed by the federal government. Puerto Rico, the site of historical toxic weapons testing and attempts at population control, is regularly referred to as a "colony" by its residents. Part of this historical throughline of subjugation is the deprioritization of these areas for the development of modern infrastructure.
